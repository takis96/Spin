The project is not running fully and correctly because I tried to implement as many things as I could. I didn't have enough time to be honest. 4 days are more than enough, but I couldn't use more than ~7 hours.
But most of things work correclty and I think that you can still have a good idea about my knowledge on Laravel and organising code.
Obviously, I 've used Laravel and mysql for the implementation.

Firstly install composer and run "composer install" before running the project in your working directory or globaly.

To run the project you need a database let's call it spin. 
CREATE DATABASE spin;
CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'new_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Then you need to add these in the .env file like this:
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=spin
DB_USERNAME=new_user
DB_PASSWORD=password

Then you need to run the migration abd the seeding (provided 2 ways for seeding, one hardcoded and one reading the excel)
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed

Finally you run the project with: "php artisan serve" 
and you can see the blade for the form on http://127.0.0.1:8000/search

I implemented the project using typical Laravel methodollogy for creating a model with factory,seeder,controller with the search functionality and corresponding APIs
Tried to implement unit tests and validation over the inputs in the request.

All in all, I think you can have a pretty good idea for my level. With some extra hours (I can't say in how many days I would have these hours) I am sure the project would be fully functional.
